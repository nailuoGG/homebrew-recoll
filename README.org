** Lazy Homebrew install for Recoll on macOS

This is just a convenience tap that packages the official Recoll macOS builds 
as a Homebrew cask. No compilation from source - just the official binaries.

** Quick Install

#+begin_src shell
brew tap nailuoGG/recoll
brew install --cask recoll
#+end_src

That's it. Run ~recoll~ to start searching.

** Details

- Uses official binaries from [[https://www.recoll.org/downloads/macos/]]
- No source compilation (QT dependencies are complex)
- Packages are not digitally signed (same as official)
- Automated updates via GitHub Actions
